# Adaptive-Empathy-Training-Simulation
This is my first project on github
Developed an interactive, web-based platform utilizing advanced Generative AI characters to create realistic, simulated scenarios for practicing empathy and high-stakes conflict resolution.
Implemented a unique "Emotional Mirror" feature, enabling AI characters to respond dynamically to user input (via text or microphone), offering a safe environment for communication skill development.
Designed a robust Post-Simulation Analysis system that delivers personalized feedback on communication metrics (e.g., talk time, word choice, empathy scoring) to identify and correct individual user blind spots.
